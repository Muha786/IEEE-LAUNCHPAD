#### Leadership and Influence:
- Building on my strong academic foundation, my experiences as a representative for MuLearn and ICFOSS College have allowed me to hone my leadership and influencing skills. Effective communication is paramount to successful leadership, and I've cultivated an open and approachable style, readily available to peers, faculty, and administration for feedback and suggestions.Furthermore, I'm a firm believer in the power of collaboration. In my role as representative, I've facilitated discussions and brainstorming sessions, ensuring diverse perspectives are incorporated into decision-making. For instance, when planning technical workshops, I formed inclusive committees involving students, faculty, and staff. This approach led to more well-rounded workshops and fostered a stronger sense of community within the college.

#### Networking:

- Where I truly excel in influencing and leading others is through knowledge sharing. I empower others by providing clear, concise, and reliable information. Whether it's detailed explanations, practical examples, or step-by-step guides, I strive to make complex concepts understandable and accessible. My goal is to equip them with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions and take action in their respective fields.
#### Career Plan:

- My career aspiration lies in building a robust startup ecosystem in Kerala. To achieve this, I plan to first conduct a comprehensive analysis of the existing strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to identify areas for improvement.  Leveraging Kerala's strong points like a talented workforce and government support, I aim to foster collaboration and online communities for entrepreneurs. Additionally, I will advocate for increased investment in R&D for emerging technologies and the development of crucial infrastructure like co-working spaces and incubators. By focusing on these key areas, I believe I can contribute significantly to Kerala's thriving startup ecosystem and its economic future.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala's rich research tradition positions it well for a booming tech startup scene. Investments in R&D focused on areas like AI's role in biology, smart agriculture IoT applications, and biomaterial development can solidify Kerala's innovative edge. Collaboration with the government on policies like R&D tax breaks and startup funding can further fuel this growth. Partnering with global tech hubs like Silicon Valley or Bangalore grants Kerala's startups access to international markets, mentors, and investors. By leveraging its strengths, fostering innovation, and creating a collaborative ecosystem, Kerala has the potential to become a leading Indian tech startup hub with a significant global presence. Strategic planning, investment, and collaboration are key to unlocking this bright future.
